This package contains Matlab implementation of the algorithm proposed in "Bayesian Multiview Dimensionality Reduction for Learning Predictive Subspaces", which is appearing in ECAI 2014.

demo.m file shows how to use the algorithm.

BMDR methods
------------
* bmdr_supervised_multiclass_classification_variational_train.m => training procedure
* bmdr_supervised_multiclass_classification_variational_test.m => test procedure
